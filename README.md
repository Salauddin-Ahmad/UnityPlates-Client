Welcome to UnityPlates, a platform dedicated to sharing food and reducing food waste! UnityPlates allows users to donate, request, update, and delete food listings, fostering a community-driven approach to addressing food scarcity and promoting sustainability.

### Key Features

Users can easily add food listings by providing details such as food name, pickup location, expiration date, quantity, and any additional notes. This feature enables users to contribute to the community by offering surplus food for donation.
